## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

What did you learn?
I learned more about the testing. I completed my tests and it was super easy to go in and debug after trying to run the tests for the first time. This was very helpful in completing the assignment.

 What confuses you? 
 It confuses me when sometimes vscode cannot find a file or location of something. Sometimes I am in a different termanial like powershell or python, and I need to be in the correct one for my tests and functions to work properly. I need help with this in class.

 Where did you struggle?
 I stuggled with the last test. Apparently openpyxl was not imported and streamlit. But i know they are installed and should be working. I got streamlit to work, but the openpyxl still does not work and my final test is failing. I do not know what to do.

  Where might you need more practice?
  I think I just need more practice learning all the streamlit functions. The co-pilot is able to help me out with most everything, and I know what is going on when it suggest something, but I wouldnt be able to do it without co pilots help. So i need to do a little more learning yet.
